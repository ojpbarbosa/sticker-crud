<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This project is a World Cup player stickers CRUD me and [Gabriel Willian Bartmanovicz](https://github.com/obielwb) developed for our Topics in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in the fourth semester the [Technical High School of Campinas](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_High_School_of_Campinas), while we were studying OOP with C++ and binary representation of data. Therefore, the data related to the CRUD is saved as a `.dat` file instead of saving it to a regular database. The UI is in Brazilian Portuguese.
